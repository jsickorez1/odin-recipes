    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck 80%-85% lean</li>
        <li>kosher or sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American or Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>4 Burger Buns</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Optional
        <li>Condiments of choice such as ketchup, mustard, and mayo. 
            Toppings such as lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground chuck in a medium-size mixing bowl and sprinkle with salt & pepper. Mix gently to combine, but don’t 
            overwork the meat. 1 pound ground chuck,kosher or sea salt to taste,freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Divide the meat into four equal portions.</li>
        <li>Place one portion on a plate and gently press it into a 1-inch thick, round patty. 
            (The patty should not be smooth – leave some craggy edges and don’t press it too flat.)</li>
        <li>With your thumb or fingers, press a “moat”, approximately ¼-½ inch from the edge, around the circumference of the burger 
            – be sure the edge of the burger is a little higher than the indentation. This will ensure the burger will flatten out while 
            cooking. Repeat this process with each portion.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, carefully place the patties in the skillet 
            (no need to grease skillet) leaving some space between each patty.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers until nicely seared and they have browned halfway up the sides.</li>
        <li>Flip the burgers and cook to your liking. (*NOTE – To ensure all bacteria has been killed, the FDA recommends cooking
             burgers to an internal temperature of 160°F.)</li>
        <li>If adding cheese: remove the pan from the heat and place the cheese atop the burgers. 
            Cover the skillet and allow the residual heat/steam to melt the cheese.</li>
    </ol>
