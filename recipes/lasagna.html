    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To prepare lasagna from scratch, you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles and cheese before
        baking. The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce, with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with
        a wide variety of vegetables.</p>
    <p>The basic building formula for lasagna is sauce, noodles, more sauce, then cheese. Repeat the noodle-sauce-cheese order
        until the pan is nearly filled, then end with sauce and cheese on top.</p>
